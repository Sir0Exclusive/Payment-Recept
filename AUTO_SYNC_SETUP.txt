AUTO-SYNC SERVICE SETUP GUIDE
==============================

WHAT IS AUTO-SYNC?
- Automatically syncs Excel (recipients_data.xlsx) ↔ Google Sheets
- Runs continuously in the background
- Checks every 30 seconds for changes
- Works when online, skips when offline
- Both sources stay identical

THREE WAYS TO USE AUTO-SYNC:

METHOD 1: RUN MANUALLY (EASIEST)
=================================
1. Double-click: START_AUTO_SYNC.bat
2. Keep the window open while working
3. Auto-sync will run continuously
4. Close the window to stop

✓ This is the simplest method for testing


METHOD 2: WINDOWS TASK SCHEDULER (RUNS AT STARTUP)
====================================================
1. Press Windows + R, type: taskschd.msc
2. Click "Create Basic Task"
3. Name: "Payment Receipt Auto-Sync"
4. Description: "Automatic bidirectional sync for Excel and Google Sheets"
5. Trigger: Select "At startup"
6. Action: Select "Start a program"
7. Program: python.exe
8. Arguments: auto_sync.py
9. Click "Create"

✓ Runs automatically every time you start your computer
✓ Syncs immediately in background


METHOD 3: KEEP RUNNING IN BACKGROUND (ADVANCED)
================================================
Create a shortcut to auto_sync.py:
1. Right-click on auto_sync.py
2. Send to → Desktop (create shortcut)
3. Right-click the shortcut
4. Properties → Advanced → Check "Run as administrator"
5. Click OK
6. Double-click whenever you start working

✓ Keeps running in background
✓ Check sync_log.txt for status


HOW TO MONITOR SYNC
===================
Open sync_log.txt to see:
- Timestamp of each sync
- Whether Excel or Google Sheets changed
- Number of records synced
- Any errors encountered

Examples of log messages:
- "✓ Synced 5 records to Excel" (data came from Google Sheets)
- "✓ Synced 5 records to Google Sheets" (data came from Excel)
- "⚠ Data mismatch detected - syncing..." (both had changes)
- "📝 Excel file changed - running sync..." (local change detected)


WORKFLOW WITH AUTO-SYNC
=======================
1. Start auto-sync: double-click START_AUTO_SYNC.bat
2. Edit Excel OR Google Sheets (whichever you prefer)
3. Changes sync automatically within 30 seconds
4. Other source updates automatically
5. Web portal sees latest data from Google Sheets

Example:
- You add payment to Excel
- Auto-sync detects change in 30 seconds
- Syncs to Google Sheets
- Website dashboard shows new payment
- Everything stays in sync


OFFLINE BEHAVIOR
================
- If Google Sheets unreachable: Excel data is preserved
- When back online: Next sync pushes Excel → Google Sheets
- No data loss, automatic recovery


WHAT SYNCS
==========
✓ Name (Recipient)
✓ Amount
✓ Due Amount (Amount due)
✓ Date
✓ Description
✓ Receipt No
✓ Payment_Status (automatically calculated as PAID/DUE)
✓ Amount_Paid (automatically calculated)

All fields are synchronized both ways.


IMPORTANT NOTES
===============
1. Auto-sync runs continuously - leave it running
2. Close auto-sync only when you need to stop syncing
3. Check sync_log.txt if sync seems stuck
4. If Google Sheets unreachable, Excel is backup
5. No manual export needed - everything syncs automatically

For daily use:
- Start auto-sync in morning
- Work on Excel or Google Sheets as normal
- Both stay synchronized automatically
- Check web portal anytime - always shows latest data
